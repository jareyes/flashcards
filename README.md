Flash Cards
==========

This repository contains collections of flash cards that have been useful to me from time to time. Rather let the original cards take up space in my apartment, I've decided to write them up in beautiful LaTeX one at  a time and share them with the world.

I use the [`FlashCards`](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/flashcards) package to typeset the cards. The current layout fits nicely on Avery 5388 index cards, but you can swap out the paper type easily should you want to print them on something else.

# Categories
Currently the cards are split up into two categories:
* Algorithms
* Data Science

Data Science is a sort of catch-all category. In the future, I'll probably add probability (since I can never remember the named distributions and their properties) and interview questions.
